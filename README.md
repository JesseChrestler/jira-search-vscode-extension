# JIRA Search Extension README

This is a simple extension that allows you to search your JIRA issues assigned to you.
Possibly in the future I will add other search/queries you can perform. 

## Installation

This is currently not published in the visual studio code market.
Simply run the following command:

`code --install-extension jira-search-0.1.0.vsix`

## Usage

Type "Jira Search My Issues"

## Features

* View issues assigned to you
* View comments on issues
* Add comments to issues
* Transition issues from one status to another

*Tip*: The list that shows when you execute the command can be filtered as you type.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:
### Configuration Required Fields

`jiraSearch.url` - base url for your jira site (ex. "http://mysite.jira.com")

`jiraSearch.username` - username for your jira account (typically not the email address)

`jiraSearch.password` - Password for your jira account

```
"jiraSearch.url" : "http://mysite.jira.com",
"jiraSearch.username" : "username",
"jiraSearch.password" : "password"
```

### Configuration (optional) 

 #### How JIRA issues will be displayed you can customize this based on your custom fields in your JIRA implementation

`jiraSearch.labelFormat` - The first part of an issue listing

`jiraSearch.descriptionFormat` - Second part. Smaller text next to the label. Issue summary by default.

`jiraSearch.detailFormat` - Appears below the label and description. Default is the issue description.

```
"jiraSearch.labelFormat" : "{fields.status.name} - [{fields.issuetype.name}][{fields.priority.name}] {key}",
"jiraSearch.descriptionFormat" : "{fields.summary}",
"jiraSearch.detailFormat" : "{fields.description}"
```

For example, the provided `labelFormat` will appear like this:

> TODO - [Bug][Major] ISSUE-1337

#### How JIRA issues will be copied to your clipboard

```
"jiraSearch.clipboardFormat": "{key} - {fields.summary} - {fields.description}"
```

#### JQL (Jira Query Language) query format (only token available is username currently). Currently will give all issues assigned to you, where status is not done, and it will be ordered by created date.
 
```
"jiraSearch.jql" : "assignee={username} and status!=Done order by created"
```

#### How often to update issues (in minutes)

```
"jiraSearch.updateInterval" : 5
```

## Known Issues

Issues will not get pulled everytime you run the command, they will only get pulled when you run the command the first time and then they will be pulled every X interval (default 5 minutes) which is customizable.
